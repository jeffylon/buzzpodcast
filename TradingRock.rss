    <title>The Mindset You Need to Conquer the CFD Market</title>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>Trader&apos;s mindset plays a vital role in CFD trading, here, I offer you, <a href='https://www.independentinvestor.com/cfd/tips/'>some principles and tips</a> for starting your path in developing the right mindset.</p><p>1. - Know what you want, and be as specific as you can.</p><p>How are you going to know if you achieved your goals if you don&apos;t know what they are? How are you going to know if you are getting closer if you don&apos;t know where are you headed?</p><p>The first step in achieving anything worthwhile in life is knowing what it is that you want.</p><p>The second part; you have to be as specific as you can. Picture this: a man goes to his boss and asks him for a rise. His boss gives him a one cent rise and sends him back to work. This man was not specific. Next time he should have a figure in mind.</p><p>2. - Don&apos;t do things half-way.</p><p>&quot;Do or do not... there is no try&quot; - Yoda</p><p>I love this quote from Star Wars. In the military people are thought that trying is failing. Don&apos;t try... do!!!</p><p>When I was young my father told me the story of Hernan Cortes. Before launching his attack he burned his ship leaving his man no other option but victory. If you really want to be a successful CFD trader, do as Cortes did, burn your ship and accept nothing but victory.</p><p>3. - Discipline</p><p>In this life nothing can be acquired without <a href='https://www.cfdspy.com/tips/discipline/'>discipline</a>. Remember the story of the turtle and the hare. In the CFD market small profits can add up very quickly if you are consistent.</p><p>4. - Watch your inner-dialogue.</p><p>If your inner dialogue makes you doubt yourself every five minutes, how are you going to have discipline? How are you going to gain the confidence needed to be a successful CFD trader? Be positive and stop talking yourself down!!</p><p>5. - Learn to think by yourself.</p><p>You need to avoid the traps of the group thinking. True achievers lead they never follow. Life gave us one Henry Ford, one Benjamin Franklin, one Steve Jobs.</p><p>Shakespeare wrote: &quot;All the world is a stage, and we are mere actors.&quot; Decide the role you are going to play in this life, don&apos;t let others decide for you.</p><p>In the CFD Market around 80% of traders are losers, do you want to follow them?</p><p>I recommend that you don&apos;t comment your CFD trading experiences with everyone. As a general rule people are not going to be very helpful. Most of the people, even the ones we love, tend to over criticize; and if you don&apos;t have an iron will it can damage, a lot, your learning process.</p><p>6. - Confidence.</p><p>We tend to be our worst enemies. Even when we did our homework and are very well prepared, when the time comes, we doubt ourselves. Confidence is not something you are born with, it is something you develop. The only practical way I know that will help you cultivate your confidence is experience. When you do things you workout your confidence muscle.</p><p>If you want to develop your confidence in the CFD trading area... trade. As time goes by you will develop a feeling of how the market works and your confidence will raise.</p><p>7. - Enjoy every part of the way.</p><p><a href='https://www.independentinvestor.com/cfd/successful-cfd-trader/'>The best traders</a> of all time are those that love their work. They enjoy every part of the trading process. Occasional setbacks are nothing to them because they know it&apos;s just part of the deal. Learn to enjoy your trading experiences and your odds will increase dramatically.</p><p>8. - Live in the moment.</p><p>When you are trading, don&apos;t think about past victories and losses; it can be very harmful. Leave your past experiences in the past. Thinking about your setbacks will damage your confidence. And thinking about your victories can easily transform you into a reckless trader. Live in the know, enjoy the moment.</p><p>I hope this is helpful. I know anyone c</p>]]></description>

    <title>Biggest Mistakes in Spread Betting</title>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>Financial spread betting (shortly spread betting) has always been a dream land for many where you can easily make as much money as you want, unfortunately, it is far from the truth as around 80 percent of <a href='https://www.independentinvestor.com/spread-betting/why-spread-bettors-lose/'>spread bettors lose money</a> and eventually exit the market.

Moreover, there is nothing called the Holy Grail or the Magic Formula and every trader can lose money, even the most experienced ones, because the financial market is extremely volatile. It does not really matter how many books on spread betting or markets have you purchased and read, it also does not matter how much time you have spent to get insights on charts, it all depends on your experience, knowledge, patience, and how the market behaves at a specific point of time.</p><p>If you want to be <a href='https://www.independentinvestor.com/spread-betting/how-to-be-successful/'>a successful spread betting trader</a>, you really need to understand that you will win one day and may lose the other day using the same trading strategy. However, a well-formulated and clearly-defined trading methodology can significantly increase your chances of making profits and reduce your chances to lose money. Unless you have a solid trading strategy and stay disciplined with it, you will be losing your money.

Retail traders should only expect above-average returns from their trades and must take only calculated risks. The best way is to trade only in those trades that offer a 3:1 ratio of profits and losses. This means that the best trades are those that are supported by financial planning and focus more to be on the safe side rather than gambling on bad trades. In addition to that, spread bettors should always emphasize on protective stops and define an exit point even before an entry point is established so that high standards of financial stability are created and managed at all times.</p>]]></description>

    <title>CFD Brokers - Getting You From Point A to Point B</title>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>You are ready and roaring to finally trade financial markets through CFDs (Contracts For Difference), but before you can actually start trading, you need to open an account with a CFD broker. The process might seem complicate but in fact, it&apos;s really straight forward and will take you just a few minutes but first you need to <a href='https://www.independentinvestor.com/cfd/brokers/'>compare CFD providers</a> and choose a broker which provides the markets you actually want to trade. It is imperative that you only consider regulated and reputable brokers and ideally with a great reputation and experience.</p><p>The shortest route to becoming an able CFD trader is by actually trading. With <a href='https://www.independentinvestor.com/cfd/cfd-trading-for-beginners/'>some basic information</a> in your pack, you can open a regular trading account with a CFD broker. After all, the main role of brokerage firms is to provide people with a <a href='https://www.cfdspy.com/cfd-brokers/'>platform</a> so they can participate in the market. However, take note that this means you will be risking some money. You need to buy financial markets you will trade. For you to do this, you will need money in your trading account. You&apos;ll surely be serious when you know your money is on the line.</p><p>But for those who&apos;d rather be safe, there&apos;s a way to get the experience without getting the risks. Again, CFDs brokers make this way possible. What you need to do is to hunt for a free demo account. Instead of opening a regular account, get the free one which is also similar to the regular in terms of appearance and functionality. The only difference is you only trade on simulated situations with the free CFD account. You are not actually connected to the real and live financial market. You may say it&apos;s like playing, but playing this game will help you hone your trading skills at no cost at all.</p><p>Next, you must remember that to get to Point B from Point A, you&apos;ll need to stock up on your knowledge bank.

    <title>Forex Trading Markets: A Head&#39;s Up for Newbies</title>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>In a simple sense, currency trading is what happens when one person buys another currency using another currency. For example, if an American guy visits India, he might need to exchange his US Dollars in Indian Rupees, for him to be able to buy products in India.</p><p>When you compare a Forex trader against the American guy in India, the only difference between them is their purpose. The American guy traded his currency because he needs to buy Indian goods. On the other, while the Forex trader exchanges his currency because he hopes to gain money when the value of the currency he bought appreciates in the future.</p><p>Gaining money in Forex trading markets is often challenging and risky. Currency trading is like buy and sell. You can buy a cheap bike, and then sell it at a higher price. In Forex, you can buy a certain currency that currently has a low value. Then, you can wait for that currency to gain a higher value. When that time comes, you can resell that currency. And of course, you will gain money in the process.</p><p>As this article mentioned a while ago, Forex is risky. The risky part is when you buy a certain currency that has a value that will soon depreciate further. If you gambled all of your money in purchasing that currency, you might need to wait a long time before you can get back the investment that you have made.</p><p>As you can see, gaining money on the currency trading market might take a while. However, it is possible that one can earn small amounts of money in short amounts of time. Traders with enough experience will be able to use their keener market sense to make these trades.</p><p>In addition, profits and losses will be only determined after you close a trade. You can learn about all of these when you practice trading in an online simulator first. This will allow you to experience trading and decide if it is something that you really want to get into.</p><p>When you decide that you want to <a href='https://www.independentinvestor.com/forex/forex-for-beginners/'>start trading currency</a> right away, you should open an account first.

    <title>Forex: The Turtle and The Hare</title>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>Dear friends, I have experienced such wonderful success over the last month and I just wanted to let you know that there is much money being made out there, you just need to go get it. I would like to talk to you today about what it takes to become a successful Forex trader. The first thing that I noticed about all of those that I have worked with and heard about, is it is of absolute necessity for traders to have the right mindset, clear thinking, that we might know exactly what to expect when day trading forex.</p><p>Another aspect of being successful in Forex is learning how to keep focus on remaining consistently profitable in the long-term trades, while still enjoying smaller short-term wins. The one single word on the lips of EVERY successful trader is &quot;consistency.&quot; Successful traders know that success means consistency more than it means immediate profits. Of course, all traders love to make the immediate profits, but the real winner in this game is the one that can do that consistently. So please remember, you may be able to get the &quot;jackpot&quot; in the Forex Market every once in a blue moon, but if you desire to get it on a longer basis, you may have to learn by being willing to accept the smaller unimpressive gains.</p><p>Traders who don&apos;t really <a href='https://www.independentinvestor.com/forex/'>understand the forex market</a> or who are hoping for a quick &quot;buck&quot; are only interested in the immediate profit; whereas successful traders understand that it&apos;s not about that, but they rather the consistent profits. I have been in this game long enough to know that ignoring the &quot;nickel &amp; dime&quot; profit trades, so to speak, and always aiming for a &quot;Mega-millions trade&quot; is a sure-fire way to become an unsuccessful Forex loser. There are no Forex gods; ones who can repeatedly predict huge gains on any single trade. There are no &quot;holy grail&quot;, though I know that you see the advertisements in the Market - no one always predicts the 400-pip trades, it just doesn&apos;t happen.</p><p>Well that was the bad news - don&apos;t always go for the &quot;monsters&quot; in the Market, now it is time for some good news. Though most people can&apos;t accurately predict the massive trades, many can and do predict a host of small-profit trades that create the same, if not more, profit than people who get extremely lucky and hit the Forex &quot;jackpot&quot; once or twice.</p><p>So what is the bottom line: Successful traders understand that a good trade is not about winning or losing; it is about whether or not they followed their forex trading plan exactly. Whether you are a beginner or someone who has been trading for years, like me, the point is that even if you lose a little money, as long as you stayed with your plan, success will follow. My suggestion would be to look at your profits at the end of each week and take a tally. Look at your pluses and your minuses and take a good look at what caused each - you will especially be looking at overall trends. Learn how to tweak some of the trends you notice and, instead of reacting to individual trades, develop a consistently profitable system of trading.</p>]]></description>
